## About
We are developing superconducting quantum processors — from the design of physical qubits to integrated processor-level systems. The project grew out of long-term experimental research at the CNRS Institut Néel in Grenoble and is dedicated to turning experimentally validated physical insights into coherent, scalable quantum hardware.

Our work addresses a central question in quantum computing: how to build processors whose reliability is inherent to their physical design, rather than maintained through increasingly complex layers of correction and control. By strengthening stability and noise resilience directly at the hardware level, we aim to reduce the operational overhead that limits the scalability of current quantum systems.

Rooted in academic research, the project is now in a pre-maturation selection phase. Our efforts focus on refining the processor architecture, verifying key integration steps, and preparing a first processor-level demonstrator in collaboration with CNRS.

This approach follows a conviction shaped by decades of experimental physics: progress toward fault-tolerant quantum computing starts with processors that are robust by design.
